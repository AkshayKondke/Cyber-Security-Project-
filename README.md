## 🔍 Overview

This repository serves as a collection of different cybersecurity tools, starting with the **Directory Brute Force Script**. The purpose of this project is to help cybersecurity enthusiasts learn penetration testing techniques like directory discovery using brute force.

The **Directory Brute Force Script** is a Python script that helps identify hidden directories on a web server by brute-forcing common directory names using a wordlist. It checks for HTTP responses like `200 OK`, `403 Forbidden`, and `404 Not Found` to reveal accessible directories or areas of interest on a website.

## 1. 📁 Directory Structure


### Current Project: Directory Brute Force Script

- **directory_brute.py**: The main Python script that performs the brute-force directory scan using a given wordlist.
- **common.txt**: A wordlist that contains commonly used directory names for the brute-force attack.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the **Directory Brute Force Script**, you’ll need the following:

- 🐍 **Python 3.x**
